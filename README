To run my parser, replace the text in the file text.BUCOL with your own BUCOL code. I have left working code in the file by default.

Then navigate to the file location in a command prompt
Then run the bash command : "sh build_and_run.sh"

The above command executes a bash script that will compile and run the project. You will get a console based output from the parser.

If you wish to change the file name of the BUCOL file, then navigate to the build_and_run.sh file and change "./executable.exe ./text.BUCOL" to ./executable.exe ./filenameHere.BUCOL.

If you wish to compile and run the project, then enter the below commands.

flex project.l

bison -d -g ./project.y

gcc -c lex.yy.c project.tab.c

gcc -o executable lex.yy.o project.tab.o

./executable.exe ./text.BUCOL
