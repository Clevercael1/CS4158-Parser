To run the lexer enter the following bash commands:

flex project.l 
gcc -o lexer lex.yy.c
.\lexer filename 

I have included an example.in file in my submission (That contains a valid example). Feel free to use the below bash command to test my lexer.

./lexer example.in

example.in is completely valid, except for one variable named 94K, when run the lexer announces this variable as being Invalid.

To run my parser, replace the text in the file text.BUCOL with your own BUCOL code. I have left working code in the file by default.

Then navigate to the file location in a command prompt
Then run the command : "sh build_and_run.sh"

The above command executes a bash script that will compile and run the project. You will get a console based output from both the lexer and the parser.

If you wish to change the file name of the BUCOL file, then navigate to the build_and_run.sh file and change "./executable.exe ./text.BUCOL" to ./executable.exe ./filenameHere.BUCOL
