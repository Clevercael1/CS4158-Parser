To run enter the following bash commands:

flex project.l 
gcc -o lexer lex.yy.c
.\lexer filename 

I have included an example.in file in my submission (That contains a valid example). Feel free to use the below bash command to test my lexer.

./lexer example.in

example.in is completely valid, except for one variable named 94K, when run the lexer announces this variable as being Invalid.
